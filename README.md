# La Lucha: The Save Hostos Movement

This online exhibit commemorates the activists who created and saved Hostos Community College in the South Bronx in the 1970s. Using images from the Gerald Meyer and Magda Vasillov Archival Collection, it preserves this pivotal history and makes it more accessible. The exhibit will raise awareness through an online display, physical exhibit, and guest speakers. It also integrates this history into the curriculum via assignments for Bronx Beautiful and other courses. Thank you to MacKenzie Scott for the grant supporting this project to promote the college's founding principles of equity, diversity, inclusion and community activism.
